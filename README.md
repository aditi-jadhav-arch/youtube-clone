# YouTube Clone 🎥

A front-end clone of the YouTube homepage built using **HTML** and **CSS**. This project replicates the layout of YouTube’s desktop UI, including the header, sidebar, and video grid. It was built as part of my learning journey to practice responsive design and clean HTML/CSS structure.
